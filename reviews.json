Good vibes, other professionals bhi hain so serious environment milta hai.\n\nStation ke paas hai, morning 9 baje easily pahunch gaya. Market close hone tak comfortable raha.

      "review_text": "As a Chartered Accountant, I needed a professional venue to meet with an important client outside my office. I booked a few hours at SkyWork Borivali and was thoroughly impressed. The meeting space was quiet and private, which was essential for discussing confidential financial matters. The location right next to Borivali station made it convenient for both me and my client to reach. The internet connection was stable throughout our meeting, allowing me to access and present financial documents seamlessly. The staff was professional and unobtrusive. The pleasant environment with city views from the 15th floor added a touch of professionalism that impressed my client. Will definitely use this space again for client meetings that require privacy and a professional setting.",

      "review_text": "Our company needed a private space for a critical 5-day process handover between departing and incoming team leaders. We booked the 2-seater cabin at SkyWork Borivali and it was perfect for our needs. The reliable WiFi allowed us to access website without interruption. The location near Borivali station was convenient for both employees. The well-maintained environment and professional atmosphere helped us complete the handover efficiently. The staff was respectful of our privacy but available whenever needed. Excellent space for business transitions and training sessions - will definitely book again for similar requirements.",
